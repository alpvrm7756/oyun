# Systems Architecture

## Engine & Technical Stack
- **Engine:** Godot 4.2+ with C# scripting for performance-critical systems; GDScript for rapid iteration tools.
- **Rendering:** Forward+ renderer with clustered lighting, screen-space global illumination, and volumetric fog.
- **Physics:** Godot Physics with custom character controller supporting slope handling, ledge detection, and ragdoll blending.
- **Networking:** Deterministic lockstep for co-op mode with rollback netcode for combat responsiveness.

## Core Modules
1. **Traversal & World Interaction**
   - Parkour system: vaulting, climbing, grappling hook, glider.
   - Dynamic navmesh streaming for seamless open world.
   - Interactable framework using signal-driven actions.
2. **Combat**
   - Action layer (real-time inputs) + Tactical layer (pause & command party).
   - Ability system with tags, cooldowns, resource costs, and element modifiers.
   - AI behavior trees with utility scoring for target selection and ability usage.
3. **RPG Progression**
   - Classless attribute web with hybrid builds (melee, ranged, arcane, technomancer).
   - Perk grid unlocked via quests, discoveries, and faction ranks.
   - Gear system with modular attachments, rarity tiers, and crafting recipes.
4. **Quest & Narrative**
   - Node-based quest graph editor with branching conditions and fail states.
   - Dialogue authored in Ink, imported via custom parser with localization support.
   - Cinematic system for key story moments (camera tracks, animations, VO playback).
5. **World Simulation**
   - Faction AI with influence maps, territory control, and supply chains.
   - Economy simulation: regional demand, scarcity events, player-driven markets.
   - Ecology loops: predator/prey behaviors, weather cycles, and environmental hazards.
6. **Tools & Pipelines**
   - World chunk editor with biomes, encounter markers, and streaming bounds.
   - Procedural population pass for flora, fauna, and ambient NPCs.
   - Build automation: nightly validation scenes, unit tests, and integration tests.

## Data & Content Management
- Use JSON/Resource files for human-readable tuning data.
- Establish GUID-based asset registry to maintain references across scenes.
- Implement patching pipeline for DLC and live updates with binary diffing.

## Technical Risks & Mitigations
- **Performance:** Budget CPU/GPU frame time per system; integrate automated frame captures.
- **Streaming:** Use hierarchical level-of-detail for meshes, textures, and AI updates.
- **Tooling Debt:** Allocate engineering time each sprint for tooling polish and documentation.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for ability math, inventory transactions, quest condition evaluation.
- Playtest bots executing traversal/combat scripts to validate AI and navmesh integrity.
- Automated cinematic validation for animation events and audio sync.

## DevOps & Release
- Continuous integration with static analysis (clang-tidy, linters), unit tests, and packaged builds.
- Crash telemetry pipeline (Sentry / self-hosted) with save data anonymization.
- Mod support via sandboxed scripting API and Steam Workshop integration.
