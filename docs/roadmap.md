# Production Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Pre-Production (3-4 Months)
- Finalize creative vision, narrative arcs, and concept art.
- Build vertical slice backlog covering traversal, combat, and a representative quest.
- Prototype core mechanics (movement, combat, dialogue) in graybox environments.
- Establish tooling pipelines (world editor, quest editor, build automation).
- Recruit core team: creative director, lead engineer, lead artist, lead designer, producer.

## Phase 1 — Vertical Slice (4-6 Months)
- Implement hero traversal set (parkour, mount, glider) with polished feel.
- Deliver one fully scripted quest chain showcasing branching outcomes.
- Build combat encounter with enemy squad variety, boss fight, and tactical pause mode.
- Integrate VO, cinematics, and UI/UX polish for the slice.
- Conduct targeted playtests to validate fun, pacing, and accessibility.

## Phase 2 — Core Systems Complete (6-8 Months)
- Harden combat, AI, progression, crafting, and economy systems.
- Expand content tooling to support distributed teams (remote asset ingest, validation).
- Stand up co-op networking prototype and stress test synchronization.
- Establish data analytics pipeline for telemetry during future playtests.

## Phase 3 — Content Expansion (9-12 Months)
- Populate all regions with handcrafted quests, dungeons, and faction arcs.
- Generate systemic contracts and procedural events to supplement bespoke content.
- Complete NPC schedules, settlement simulations, and world reactions.
- Iterate on art direction: finalize biome palettes, VFX library, and animation polish.

## Phase 4 — Alpha & Polish (6-8 Months)
- Lock feature scope; focus on bug fixing, performance optimization, and UX improvements.
- Run closed alpha with daily telemetry reviews and community feedback loops.
- Localize core languages and accessibility features.
- Implement achievements, mod hooks, and post-launch live ops tooling.

## Phase 5 — Beta & Launch Prep (3-4 Months)
- Content complete, only critical bugs remain.
- Conduct open beta, load testing, and certification passes for target platforms.
- Finalize marketing beats, trailers, and press demos.
- Prepare day-one patch, server infrastructure, and customer support workflow.

## Post-Launch (Ongoing)
- Seasonal content drops with new regions, quests, and gear sets.
- Live balance patches informed by telemetry and community council.
- Mod spotlights and creator partnerships to expand ecosystem.
