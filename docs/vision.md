# Creative Vision & Worldbuilding

## Core Fantasy
Deliver an epic open-world adventure where players shape the fate of a fractured continent, balancing exploration, political intrigue, and high-stakes combat. The fantasy should blend grounded cultures with mystical technology, giving players both relatable social dynamics and awe-inspiring magical phenomena.

## Pillars
1. **Player Agency:** Choices across quests, dialogue, and faction alliances have lasting systemic consequences.
2. **Meaningful Exploration:** Each biome contains bespoke points of interest, environmental storytelling, and traversal challenges.
3. **Tactical Combat:** Hybrid action/RTS-inspired combat with pausable command mode, elemental combos, and squad AI customization.
4. **Living World Simulation:** Factions, economies, and ecosystems react to player actions through dynamic schedules and procedural events.

## Tone & Inspirations
- Narrative tone similar to *The Witcher 3* or *Disco Elysium*: mature themes, sharp dialogue, layered moral dilemmas.
- Visual inspirations drawn from *Ghost of Tsushima* (composition), *Nausicaä* (environmental storytelling), and *Arcane* (stylized realism).

## Player Fantasy Progression
- **Origin Stories:** Three starting regions with unique prologues and mechanical tutorials.
- **Reputation & Influence:** Faction reputation trees unlock signature abilities, gear, and political leverage.
- **Legacy System:** Endgame meta-progression encourages New Game+ with modifiers, unlocking ancestral traits that remix future playthroughs.
